# NBL Data Science Project
This project is designed to develop my own skills within sport analytics. The specific skills I am looking to develop in coding are improved efficiency with python and libraries such as Pandas and matplotlib.

All other projects used to assist me on this journey will be refrenced in the README as well as in a word document formal report. 


## Ideas to be investigated during the project
1.  Does the rate of growth in the NBA's 3 pointer boom match that in NBL in the years 2011-2019?
2. Is there a relationship between 3-pointers and the placement at the end of the season?

## Procedure 
1. Scrape NBL Data for the years 2011-2019 
2. Scrape NBA Data for the years 2011-2019
