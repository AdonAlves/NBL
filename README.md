# NBL Data Science Project
This project is designed to develop my own skills within sport analytics. The specific skills I am looking to develop in coding are improved efficiency with python and libraries such as Pandas and matplotlib.

All other projects used to assist me on this journey will be refrenced in the README as well as in a word document formal report. 


## Ideas to be investigated during the project
1.  Does the rate of growth in the NBA's 3 pointer boom match that in NBL in the years 2011-2019?
2. Is there a relationship between 3-pointers and the placement at the end of the season?

## Procedure 
1. Scrape NBL Data for the years 2011-2019 
2. Scrape NBA Data for the years 2011-2019
3. Use data to calculate the average number of three pointers made per game in the NBL vs NBA. 
4. Discuss data

## Information Gathered 
The Four Factor models for team offense and defense from the book Mathletics
Offense: 
  1. EFG 
  2. TPP 
  3. ORP 
  4. FTR
Defense: 
  1. Opponent EFG 
  2. Defensive TPP 
  3. DRP 
  4. Opponents FTR

## Notes 

01/08/2020 - decided it would be a good idea to work on a per minute basis, rather than per game as the NBA and NBL run for different lengths and would be a superior method of comparison. This invollves changing the data scraper to select the the per minute basis on Real GM.  The code to scrape the data will be updated shortly 
 - further adjustments to the model will have to be made to account for the differences in the NBL vs NBA. 
08/08/2020 - during the week I created an alternative model, which will be uploaded soon. While browising youtube today I came across Ofer Habushi, with his data project into the NBA. I decided to have a look and take some components on board. Such components include recursive feature elimination.
